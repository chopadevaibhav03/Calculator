<!-- 

Technically HTML Element is  start tag, attributs, end tag and content between them.
There are tow types of Element in HTML Block - Level Element and Inline Element.

Block - Level Element :- A Block level element takes up whole Horizontal space of a parent element as well vertical space equal to the Height of Content , resulting in the formation of "Block".
A Block level element always begins with new line and accupies the entire available width.

INLINE ELEMENT:-  Inline element simply take up space defined  by the tag  that define the element rather than inrrupting flow of  the content.
An Inline element dont begins on new line and take up as much space as is required . -->
